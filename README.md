# Apoli working fork branch

This is a discontinued working branch for this fork of the Apoli mod. Its original purpose was to keep up with the dev branch of the main repository to build up to a big pull request, but it was decided to fragment it into several requests, due to the sheer amount of changes this branch provides. It will be kept for legacy purposes.
